          <p>
            509 Fingerboards are 100% handmade. Each deck is cut, dyed, sanded and shaped by hand while using the best and highest quality veneer. 509 FB started during the holidays of 2019 when I received my first custom fingerboard mold. Since then Iâ€™ve been in the process of getting the first official stock ready for launch while continuing to practice the craft by making decks for myself and my homies. With a variety of differently sized and shaped decks to choose from there's something for everybody.
